      <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
          I had a preexisting love for working on computers. As a kid, I remember building 386's from scavenged parts in our garage, and I'm often fixing (sometimes further breaking) my trusting friends' computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A light bulb went off: <strong>coding</strong>.
        </p>

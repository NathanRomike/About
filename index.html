    <h2>My background</h2>
      <p>My post-high school education has meandered a bit. I started at Portland Community College, transfer to Western Oregon University, deciding against a business degree, I came back to Portland and went to Portland State University. I had always wanted to be an architect and spent two years trying to fight my way through the program at PSU. Admitting defeat, I transferred to PCC and obtained a general Associates Degree.

        Not knowing what to make of myself, I found Epicodus. A lightbulb went off: <strong>coding</strong>.
        I had a preexisting love for working on computers. I remember building 386's from scavenged parts in my parent's garage as a kid, and I'm often fixing (sometimes further breaking) my friend's computers. With little prior experience in code, but a lot more thought and soul searching, I applied and can't wait to see where this path takes me.

        <br>
      My work history has similarly meandered. I've worked as a grocery checker, a mover, a landscaper, a file clerk, and spent the past few years as a legal assistant. I was drawn to coding as it can be applied to seemingly endless ventures. I'm excited to have found a career path which can fulfill my desire for creativity.</p>
